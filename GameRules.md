# Introduction #

Starshooter is a Space Combat Flight Simulator in 3D space where the player and his/her faction fight against an enemy faction.


# Details #

Player must destroy enough Capital Ships and enemy starfighters to reach a certain score in order to achieve victory.
  * Capital Ships are worth a ton more points, so the only real way to end the game is to destroy a few Capital Ships.
  * Enemy fighters will always be a hassle and so will present themselves to the player to be destroyed, but they will not go down without a fight.
  * Later when the game grows, enemies will fly in swarm-formations and will always try to get in front of the player to do their dance (whatever form they are executing).

Destroying Capital Ships also brings in more allies.
  * Upon destroying an enemy Capital Ship, the player will receive a ship on his faction of equal class.
  * Note that the Player's and enemy's factions both usually start off with equal amounts of Capital Ships.

The enemy's and Player's factions are not necessarily equal.
  * The enemy's faction, the Astropyre, has many more fighters than the Player's faction (types and quantity).
  * The Player's faction, the Starshooters, has more powerful fighters than the Astropyre, so they last longer.

All fighters will spawn from any ship with a docking bay aboard.
  * In theory, each bay represents a certain number of fighters that can exist on the map at any given time; however, there would likely be too many.
  * The maximum populations of fighters on the screen at any given time will be significantly smaller, but will still be high:  like 100 vs. 300 (Astropyres have more).
  * The maximum score should always prevent the player or enemy to reduce the opposite team below the max pop.
  * The Player gets to choose which Capital Ship to spawn from and then select which fighter he/she will pilot.
